If you see any discrepancies, *please* raise an issue and provide the scripted schema and results + the results you would have expected!\r\n  * The T-SQL Flex window is no longer a tool window; it is now a proper tab in SSMS, so using it should me much more natural.\r\n\r\n![tsqlflex-0 0 2-alpha](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3755379/3254050/41e04522-f1ea-11e3-8d66-088dd6dadbf3.png)\r\n\r\nUpgrading to v0.0.2-alpha:\r\n  * Quit out of SSMS.\r\n  * Overwrite the three old DLLs with the ones from the new ZIP file.\r\n  * Re-launch SSMS and you should be on your way.\r\n\r\nKnown issues (should be fixed in next version):\r\n  * If you have text selected in the top panel of T-SQL Flex, the Run'n'Rollback button still runs the entire top panel's statements.  This is not technically a bug, but it will be fixed in the next version regardless.\r\n  * There is no way to tell what version of T-SQL Flex you have via the UI.\r\n  * ADO.NET hidden fields aren't respected so selecting from stuff with hidden fields such as INFORMATION_SCHEMA can be problematic.\r\n\r\nPlease log issues on GitHub or reach out to Steve on Twitter at [@nycdotnet](https://twitter.com/nycdotnet).\r\n"},
